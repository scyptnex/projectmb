Hey Nic,

It seems that chat is broken at the moment. the myid.equals(myID.uname) line seems to be the cause.

I'm gonna work on the report for a bit then fix up my payment stuff. I think we (and by that I mean 'I') should do a separate connection for the bank, but still within the server. So I'll do that later as well.
