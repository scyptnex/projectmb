Hey Nic, hopefully you read this.

Last night I got most of the authentication stuff done but I ran into some problems. Firstly, with RSA encryption it seems that we cannot encrypt anything of largeish length. It throws IllegalBlockSizeException (or something), which apparently should never happen when we use padding (which we do). And using update instead of doFinal doesn't help.

Secondly, a similar issue with AES. It's giving me a block size exception this time. I can encrypt and decrypt the message on the server side, but when I try to make a packet out of it and send it to the server, it doesn't decrypt. I've just had a horrible thought that I forget to deal with the command byte, so I'll check if that's the problem later. It was 1am when I was doing this so it's entirely possible I did something stupid like that.

Anyway, I still haven't looked at client/client stuff but it should be the same anyway. I'll have another crack at it tonight hopefully.
