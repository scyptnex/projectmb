Ah, I read it wrong. It used the word secret so I assumed it was talking about the secret file exchange stuff, but obviously it's just talking about the private/public key files.

I'll do the encryption if you like, this report won't take long.

Don't look at my payment protocol code btw. I stopped caring about 20min into writing it. (And it's not quite done.)

Also, I got bored.

I'm off to bed, will look at preventing replay when i get to uni early tomorrow probably

I'm storing files local to the server, the historically remembered login credentials of users
i.e. if a user logs in for the 2nd time the server checks that it is the same person
Currently those files are unencrypted, this may cause problems but is a 20 minute fix if need be (i'm ignoring it for now)
Clients do not try to remember each-other's public keys, they trust the server to provide them

Currently all chatting uses public key authentication via the server, will add to file-sending shortly

This is becoming a massive hack :)

Oops, sorry about that. I merged like 3 times before I actually pushed. Fun times.

For the report, I'm stealing your explanation of key exchange from last time. That's most of it written for me. Awesome.

Reading through the assignment I just noticed that we have to store files on the server. Are you doing that or should I?

PS: Until I get bored of it all of my commit messages are now song lyrics (inc the last two)
