Oops, sorry about that. I merged like 3 times before I actually pushed. Fun times.

For the report, I'm stealing your explanation of key exchange from last time. That's most of it written for me. Awesome.

Reading through the assignment I just noticed that we have to store files on the server. Are you doing that or should I?

PS: Until I get bored of it all of my commit messages are now song lyrics (inc the last two)
